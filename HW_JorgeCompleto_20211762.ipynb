    "\n",
    "The goal of the midterm assignment is to test your familiarity with the concepts you have learned during the first 7 weeks of the semester. But above all, it is an opportunity for you to challenge yourself and practice. If you are having difficulties with the assignment reach out for support through the Discussion Forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  Assigment is divided into __3 parts__:\n",
    "1. Explore the core building blocks of programming, focusing in variables, data structures, and their manipulation;\n",
    "2. Focuses in data loading and analysis using the core elements of Python, without fancy third-party libraries; \n",
    "3. Focus in functional programming and will require you to define different functions and operate with the map() and filter();\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Comment your code properly, which includes naming your variables in a meaningful manner. Badly documented code will be penalized.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be graded according to the following guidelines:\n",
    "1. **Execution** (does your program does what is asked from the exercise?)\n",
    "2. **Objectivity** (do you use the most adequate libraries?)\n",
    "3. **Readibility** of your code (that includes comments, naming of variables, supporting text, etc ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is Individual, students that are caught cheating will obtain a score of 0 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Homeworking Assignment One is worth 40% (8.00 values) of your final grade.__\n",

    "1. **Jupyter Notebook** with the output of all the cells;\n",

    "\n",
    "K-Means is one of the most popular \"clustering\" algorithms, which you perhaps are already familiar from Data Mining or Machine Learning curricular units. K-means estimates the location of $k$ centroids that represent the typical value in each cluster. In that sense, an observation is considered to be part of a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than of any other centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is iterative and can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. Start by choosing value K (number of clusters) that defines the number of clusters;\n",
    "2. Initialize the locations of the centroids, which we can do by randomly select K points from your dataset as initial locations of the centroids;\n",
    "3. Calculate distance of all other points to each of the K centroids;\n",
    "4. Associate each point to the cluster of the closest centroid;\n",
    "5. Update the centroid position, by computing the average coordinates of all points assigned to each cluster;\n",
    "6. Evaluate the average change in the centroids positions, as a measure of convergence (we assume algorithm converged to the solution when the positions of the centroids don't change more than a given tolerance threshold);\n",
    "7. Repeat steps 3-6 until either the centroids no longer move more than a tolerance threshold or until you repeated these steps at least for specified number of iterations (niter)\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is thus parametized by the number of clusters (K), the maximum number of iterations (niter), and the tolerance threshold (tol).\n",

    "It is important that we devise a strategy to test our code at each step, in order to assess if it performs as expected. To that end, we have split each step of the algorithm into different blocks, and we ask you to test each block against a simple scenario where the outcome is predictable and can be computed by hand. In some steps, however, we want to pass a more comprehensive dataset with similar properties to the real dataset that we will be working with.<br>\n",
